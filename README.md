# Tea-Cozy
This is my assignment submission where I was tasked to replicate a site's style and design to what the end-client had specified. This site utilizes HTML and advanced CSS. It's about tea! I could go for some Anise, Moroccan, or even Green Tea right now... 

You can view the live site at the following URL: https://mjihaduddin00.github.io/Tea-Cozy/

Thanks!
